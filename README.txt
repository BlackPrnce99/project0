This is the foundation of a website for a South African wildlife
photography company.
The company books guided photography tours throughout Southern Africa, 
and offers online courses taught by professional wildlife phtotographers.

This is the home page of the site. The large banner images work as a menu 
(though I am putting a menu bar in shortly).

The body (under the fold) will contain basic information about the 
company, and links to different pages.

The bottom portion of the page includes a grid-gallery of different
photos taken by trip attendees, students, and teachers.
